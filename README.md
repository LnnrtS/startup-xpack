## The ÂµOS++ portable startup code for bare-metal platforms

This project provides a portable startup code for bare-metal platforms.

The myth that startup code must be written in assembly because 'the C environment is not ready' is plainly wrong.

The 'C environment' is mainly the stack (and maybe other architecture ABI registers, like GP on RISC-V), and this can be set in a short assembly entry code and then the standard `_start()` function can be safely called.
